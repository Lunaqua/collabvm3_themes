# Disc Dock for CollabVM

A small disc images dock for CollabVM. Requires tamper/grease/violent etc. -monkey.
Incomplete but functional.
Should work with at least the current and 3.0 "experimental" web application.

[Download](https://github.com/Lunaqua/collabvm3_themes/raw/refs/heads/discdock/discdock/collabvm_discdock.js)

Refer to previous dir README for a tad more info.
Consider this a sub project.

Still need to:

- Fill out disc images menu
- Floppy menu
- Bit of CSS cleaning
- check it works in classic webapp
