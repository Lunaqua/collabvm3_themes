# CollabVM 3 Themes

This userscript provides basic theming functionality with CollabVM 3 (or
whatever they end up calling it). This is currently available via public beta
at 
[https://computernewb.com/collab-vm/experimental-vm](https://computernewb.com/collab-vm/experimental-vm)
. This script does 
**not** work with CollabVM 1.2, neither the current, or old (classic)
web application. 

This script is for use with a userscript extension such as 
[TamperMonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/). It might work with 
[GreaseMonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/) as well.
