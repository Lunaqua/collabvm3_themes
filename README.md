# CollabVM 3 Themes

This userscript provides basic theming functionality with CollabVM 3 (or
whatever they end up calling it). This is currently available via public beta
at [https://computernewb.com/collab-vm/experimental-vm]. This script does 
**not** work via CollabVM 1.2, neither the current, or old (classic)
web application. 

This script is for use with a userscript extension such as 
[https://www.tampermonkey.net/ TamperMonkey]. A quick download for such 
extensions is available [here]. 

Pre-1.6 releases can be found in old/.
